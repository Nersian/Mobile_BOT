## Create your own Bot with vTask! 
vTask is a program which allows you to create scripts to automate your work with Windows. The biggest advantage of vTask is how easy it is to use even with zero knowledge about programing. The only think you need is to know what exactly your script going to do. 

## Patterns
Every project related to gaming brings additional fun, make it easier and faster to learn about new technologies (at least for me) than by doing some typical copy paste project. By that i thought about changing typical range of program function and make something that could be used in gaming. The only title that i could find nice pattern of redoing one and the same action would be one of mobile game i played with some time. To ensure that no one related to the games community won't going to find it and use it for boting i'm going to called this game "X". 

"X" is typical Gacha type game. As a player your job is to make your team stronger by leveling your monsters that you acquire from gatcha and put "runes" on them. Runes can be obtain by running instances. With knowledge about pattern of the whole one run you can create a blok diagram of every posibility (winning, losing, obtaining different items). In case of game X i wanted to make script which can automate procces of running one instance to moment of running low on energy. Block Diagram of patterns should look like this:

## "Coding" 
As I said earlier vTask doesn't required coding skill. By draging "Action" to your script and addjusting it's parameters to your heart content it's easy to build functional program espetialy with hand drawn diagram. Making it beforehand shorten time of making your code. With trial and error method, bit by bit u can adjust your script to newly finds problem like time delay between the next image, or finding golden value of image required match parameters , or changing the search field to make your program run more smoothly. Additionaly you can add variable to your script to increase information about your Wining/Loses Ratio.

## Phone mirroring 
Of course using screen mirroring is not neceserry, there are plenty of way to access games like running Androids emulator like nox or Bluestack. In this case I decide to use screen mirroring program called Mobizen beacuse it doesn't require too much RAM which is good for lower spec PC. Connecting your phone with mobizen is quite easy you can use your USB cable or connect your phone to the same Wi-Fi as your PC that running script. The only thing you need is to lunch your app and click one button to automate farming process.
